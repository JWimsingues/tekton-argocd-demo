Classic example of argocd: add a repository
Enter the following details and click on Create.
Application Name: cluster-configs
Project: default
Sync Policy: Manual
Repository URL: https://github.com/jwimsingues/tekton-argocd-demo
Revision: HEAD
Path: argocd/cluster_config
Destination: https://kubernetes.default.svc
Namespace: default
Directory Recurse: checked

Now let's say I have 2 teams, team 1 and team 2, 
team 1 is not that mature, team 2 is fully using the potential of OC gitops and OC pipelines
for security reason, we do not want team 1 and team 2 to have the same argocd argocd instance
also, we can to keep it splited from ours and we want them to be autonomous on their code

oc new-project team1
oc create -f argocd.yaml
oc extract secret/argocd-team1-cluster --to=-

let's see the code of team 1
Application Name: spring-petclinic
Project: default
Sync Policy: Automatic
Self-heal: checked
Repository URL: https://github.com/jwimsingues/tekton-argocd-demo
Revision: HEAD
Path: argocd/team1/spring-petclinic

----
oc new-project team2
oc create -f argocd.yaml
oc extract secret/argocd-team2-cluster --to=-

Application Name: iac
